### Full Stack Web Development Learning Guide

#### 1. Understanding Web Development Concepts

**Tech Stacks**
- Start by watching a brief overview of tech stacks on Fireship's YouTube channel ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxxw3qtb3_g)). This will give you a foundational understanding of different technologies used in web development.

**REST APIs**
- Grasp the concept of REST APIs through two resources: 
  - An introductory video by IBM Technology ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsMQRaeKNDk))
  - A more in-depth explanation by InterviewDOT ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io4bjADJ2rs))

#### 2. Frontend Development

**NextJS 13 - App Router**
- Dive into NextJS 13 and its app router by watching a tutorial by developedbyed ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbYBgy_ChGY)). This will help you understand NextJS 13's concepts.
- Further, explore NextJS's official documentation on routing ([link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation) and [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)).

**TailwindCSS**
- Refresh your knowledge on TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Visit the official documentation for installation and usage guides ([link](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)).

### Backend Development with tRPC

When diving into backend development, tRPC is a powerful tool to consider. It offers a simplified approach to building APIs without the need to define schemas or generate code. Here's a structured guide to help you understand and implement tRPC in your backend development.

#### Understanding tRPC

**Getting Started with tRPC**
- Begin by exploring the official tRPC documentation. This is a great resource for understanding the basics and setting up tRPC in your projects ([tRPC Getting Started](https://trpc.io/docs/getting-started)).

#### Learning Resources

**Video Tutorials**
- To supplement the documentation, several YouTube tutorials can provide more in-depth insights and practical examples:
  1. Vercel's tutorial on tRPC implementation offers a comprehensive guide, ideal for beginners ([Vercel tRPC Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LYM8gf184U)).
  2. Matt Pocock's video is another valuable resource, delving into specific aspects of tRPC and its usage ([Matt Pocock's tRPC Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6rcrkbsDI0)).
  3. For more advanced concepts and practical implementations, watch Marcon's tutorial ([Marcon's Advanced tRPC Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DyAyLdVW0I)).

**Applying Your Knowledge**
- Once you've gone through the documentation and tutorials, the next step is to implement tRPC in a project. Start with a simple backend application to familiarize yourself with its setup and basic functionalities. Gradually, as you become more comfortable, you can tackle more complex applications.

**Experimentation**
- Experiment with different features of tRPC, like query, mutation, and subscription handlers. Try integrating it with databases and other backend technologies you're familiar with.

**Debugging and Optimization**
- Learn to debug and optimize your tRPC implementation. Understanding how to troubleshoot and enhance performance is crucial in backend development.
