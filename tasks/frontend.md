# Frontend Developer Task: Build a Blog Application Using Next.js 14

## Objective
Create a high-performance blog application using Next.js 14, inspired by the design and functionality of the [Dub.co blog](https://dub.co/blog). The application should prioritize speed, incorporate sleek and modern styling, and support image integration.

## Key Requirements

### Design and Layout
- The blog's design should closely resemble the "Dub.co" blog. Pay special attention to layout, color scheme, typography, and navigation elements.
- Ensure the user interface is sleek, modern, and responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.

### Next.js 14 Features
- Utilize Next.js 14 for the project. Leverage its latest features to ensure optimal performance and developer experience.
- Implement partial pre-rendering to improve loading times. Static Generation (`getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`) should be used for blog posts, with Server-Side Rendering (`getServerSideProps`) for dynamic content.

### Content Management
- Integrate a headless CMS (like Contentlayer, Sanity, or Strapi) to manage blog posts.
- Ensure the system allows for easy addition, modification, and deletion of posts, as well as image integration.

### Image Handling
- Incorporate an efficient method for handling images. This includes uploading, storing, and displaying images within blog posts.
- Use Next.js image optimization features to ensure fast loading times without sacrificing image quality.

### Performance Optimization
- The application must score highly on web performance metrics (use tools like Lighthouse for assessment).
- Implement best practices for code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient resource management.

### SEO and Accessibility
- Ensure the blog is SEO-friendly with proper meta tags, structured data, and URL structure.
- The application should adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring it is usable by as many people as possible.

### Testing and Documentation
- Write unit and integration tests for major components and functionalities.
- Provide comprehensive documentation on the project setup, architecture, and how to update/manage content.

### Deployment
- Deploy the application on a platform like Vercel or Netlify.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional blog application deployed to a web server.
- Source code hosted on a repository (e.g., GitHub) with clear instructions in the README.
- A Demo Video.
- A report on performance metrics and steps taken for optimization.
