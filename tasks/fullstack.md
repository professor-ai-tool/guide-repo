- Just something to get an idea of your skills

## Objective
Develop a web-based chat interface that enables users to query content extracted from PDF documents. Utilize AI to generate contextual embeddings for text segments and employ vector similarity search to find the most relevant responses. The project involves developing the interface using Next.js 14.

### Part 1: AI Model Development and Vector Similarity Search

#### PDF Content Extraction
- Utilize a robust PDF parsing library to extract text, ensuring clean, pre-processed output for accuracy in content retrieval.

#### Embedding Generation
- Employ a tool like Langchain for prompt generation, creating contextual embeddings for text segments. Fine-tune this model on your PDF data to ensure high relevance and contextuality.

#### Vector Database Integration
- Leverage Pinecone (or similar) for storing embeddings and implementing vector similarity search for efficient and relevant text segment retrieval.

#### API Development
- Design a RESTful API interfacing with the vector database to fetch and serve text segments based on user queries, with robust error handling.

### Part 2: Chat Interface Development Using Next.js 14

#### Chat UI Development
- Create a responsive chat interface enabling real-time user queries and displaying API responses in a conversational format.

#### Integration with AI API
- Ensure seamless communication between the chat interface and the AI backend, displaying relevant PDF text segments as chat responses.

#### User Feedback Integration
- Incorporate feedback mechanisms for response relevancy and accuracy, aiding future improvements.

### Part 3: Continuous Improvement and Learning

#### Model Refinement
- Use user feedback and interaction data to refine the embedding model, adopting an iterative improvement approach.

#### Chat UI Enhancement
- Continuously explore Next.js 14 features to enhance the chat UI, focusing on user engagement, accessibility, and convenience features like voice input.
